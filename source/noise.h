To do this, we need to do first pick a weight w, from the distribution {Prob(a weight k binary string) | k >= d} where Prob(â€¦) is the Binomial distribution. So then the probability of picking w will be \binom{n}{w}p^w (1-p)^(n-w)/Z where Z is a normalization that only depends on d, so it can be precomputed.
	2. Now we are guaranteed that all errors we sample are not trivially correctable.
	3. Now, once we do MonteCarlo with this sampling and estimate a decoding success rate (or a failure rate), s, we know that
			S = Z + (1 -Z) s
	where S is the true decoding success rate had we included the trivial errors (that are of weight less than d). So once we have s from Monte-Carlo, we can report S given by the above formula.
